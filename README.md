# Movie Database JDBC DAO

This Java project demonstrates the implementation of a Data Access Object (DAO) for managing a movie database using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). The project includes a `MovieDAOImpl` class that provides methods for creating tables, performing CRUD operations on the 'MOVIES' table, and interacting with a relational database.
